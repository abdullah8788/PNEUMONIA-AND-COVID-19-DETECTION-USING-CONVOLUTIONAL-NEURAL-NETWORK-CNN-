     <h1>Protect yourself and those around you:</h1>
<p>
Get vaccinated as soon as it’s your turn and follow local guidance on vaccination.<br>
Keep physical distance of at least 1 metre from others, even if they don’t appear to be sick. Avoid crowds and close contact.<br>
Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not possible and in poorly ventilated settings.<br>
Clean your hands frequently with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.<br>
Cover your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Dispose of used tissues immediately and clean hands regularly. <br>
If you develop symptoms or test positive for COVID-19, self-isolate until you recover.

    <h1>What are possible complications of COVID pneumonia?</h1>
<p>
COVID pneumonia is a complication of a COVID-19 infection, on a spectrum of how sick you can get from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. You can think of a COVID-19 infection in stages of severity:

Viral respiratory illness: The mildest stage of a COVID-19 infection, which can still make you feel pretty sick with symptoms like fever, sore throat and shortness of breath. Many people can manage their symptoms at home, but if symptoms worsen, you may need to be hospitalized.
COVID pneumonia: An infection in your lungs that causes inflammation and fluid to build up, making it hard to breathe. If you have COVID pneumonia, expect to stay in the hospital where they can keep a close eye on your condition and treat your symptoms. This is usually considered moderate to severe COVID-19.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): ARDS is a form of respiratory failure where your lungs don’t work properly and you can’t get enough oxygen. You’ll need to be on a ventilator to breathe for you if you are in this critically ill stage of COVID-19.
