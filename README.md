# PNEUMONIA-AND-COVID-19-DETECTION-USING-CONVOLUTIONAL-NEURAL-NETWORK-CNN-
Welcome to our Pneumonia and COVID-19 Detection project repository! In the face of global health challenges, this project leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to provide a reliable and efficient solution for the early detection of pneumonia and COVID-19 from medical imaging data.
